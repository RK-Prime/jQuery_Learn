Learning jQuery

Learning and upskilling is an important aspect of being a human, and inorder to do that we have to keep on working and passing out our limits.
And i am doing it by learning different things, as i have started learning jQuery and i had set the goal as learning the basics of jQuery in 3 to 5 days,
and will use it to create future projects, and will also use it in my previously created project.

Thank you Reading me.
