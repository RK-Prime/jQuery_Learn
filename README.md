Learning jQuery

Learning and upskilling is an important aspect of being a human, and inorder to do that we have to keep on working and passing our limits everytime.
And i am doing it by learning different things, as I have started learning jQuery and had set the goal as 'learning the basics of jQuery in 3 to 5 days',
and will be using it to create upcoming future projects, and will also be using it in my previously created project.

Thank you Reading me.
